Free font containing Russian and American sign language alphabets.

## To Make a Long Story Longer
When working on ‘Rocketbank Without Borders’ project spring 2019, I discovered that there was only one available font for Russian sign language alphabet. It was created back in 2001 and basically consists of scanned pictures put into a font file.

At first I tried to re-draw what we found, but it didn’t look like what I wanted (at all). So, I took photos of all signs and worked with the photos after. 

Sign language alphabet is used by people with hearing loss when there is no particular gesture for a word and separate letters are needed. For example, there is a gesture for ‘bread’, but ‘singularity’ or ‘Montana’ would require letters. And this is what my font is here for.
